# This Only scales to 4 spines, 10 leafs, 4 borders. By default the following ports are used:
# SPINE-to-LEAF = Eth1/1 - 1/10                         SPINE-to-Border = Eth1/11 - 1/14
# LEAF-to-SPINE = Eth1/1 - 1/4                          BORDER-to-SPINE: = Eth1/1 - 1/4
# MLAG Peer-link = Eth1/5 - 1/6                         MLAG keepalive = mgmt

# How big the network is, so the number of each switch. border/leaf must be in increments of 2 as in MLAG pair
