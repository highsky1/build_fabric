###################### Service: Routing Protocols ######################
# Create BGP peerings, non-backbone OSPF processes and static routes
# Filtered and weighted redistribution is supported (connected, static, bgp, ospf) with the use of the metric
# Keywords 'any' and 'default' can be used instead of the list of prefixes (can use 'ge' and/or 'le') with filtering and redistribution

####### Static route variables #######
# Routes are added per-tenant from a list of routes. Tenant, switch and prefix are lists to allow applying the same routes across multiple devices and tenants
# Can optionally set the interface, administrative distance of the route and whether the next hop is in a different VRF (for route leaking)

# At a minimum the following settings need to be configured:
# - tenant: list                      List of tenants to create all routes
#   switch: list                      List of switches to create all routes on (alternatively can be set per-route)
#   route:                            List of routes. For routes with same values (i.e gateway), only need one route element and list them in 'prefix'
#   - prefix: [10.10.10.0/24]
#     gateway: 1.1.1.1

####### BGP variables #######
# Majority of settings can be configured under group or peer. Group applies to all peers within it, however Peer settings will take precedence over group
# Switch and tenant must be a list (even if is a single device) to allow the same group and peers to be created on/in multiple devices/tenants
# A group does not need to have a switch defined, it will be automatically created on any switches that peers within it are created on
# 'inbound' and 'outbound' (set in group and/or peer) hold the settings for prefix filtering and BGP attribute manipulation.
# 'as_path' and 'med' can be applied to outbound advertisements and 'weight' and local preference applied to those received inbound
# 'tnt_advertise' (not mandatory) advertises prefixes on a per-tenant basis (list of VRFs) using network, summary and redistribution
# switch can be set globally for all network/summary/redist in a VRF and be overridden on an individual per-prefix basis
# 'summary' and 'network' only need multiple lists of prefixes if have different advertisements on different switches, otherwise all the prefixes can be in the one list
# Each 'redist' element is the redistribution type, can have ospf_xx, static and connected. Redistributed routes can be weighted using metric (MED in BGP) and/or filtered

# At a minimum the following settings need to be configured:
# group
# - name: string                      Name of the group (used in group name and RM/PL names)
#   switch: list                      List of switches to create group and peers on, could be specified in peer (still has to be list if is only 1)
